JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is an open standard file format, and data interchange format, that uses human-readable text to store and transmit data objects consisting of attributeâ€“value pairs and array data types.
Our JSON file which consists of annotated images will be used in Object Detection using YOLO.

1. "size" represents size of the image in bytes
2. "regions" denotes the number of properties of regions in the annotated image. In our case, we have two attributes: 
	"shape_attributes"
	"region_attributes"

3. "shape_attributes": It lists the properties of the bounding box.
	"name" denotes the name of the bounding box (rectangle in our case)
	"x" and "y" denote the coordinates of the top left corner of the bbox
	"width" and "height" denote the width and height of the bbox respectively
	
4. "region_attributes": It tells us the properties of the bounding box.
	"class" denotes the labelled class of the object inside the bbox (hardhat in our case)
