# Session 14

1. Hardhat, Vest, Mask, and Boots Annotated Dataset [Link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1EqtOpF7cS74C56EaVQoKNkQmpT6_HFL2/view?usp=sharing)

![Annotated Dataset](https://github.com/rishabh-bhardwaj-64rr/EVA5/blob/master/S14/images/yolov3%20dataset.png)
* 'images' folder contains all 3590 images.
* 'labels' folder contains the .txt files for all the images depicting the positions of the bounding boxes.
* 'classes' contains four dataset classes viz. hardhat, vest, mask, and boots.
* 'train' and 'test' files contain the location of the train and test images (nearly 10:1 ratio)

2. Monocular Depth Estimation Images Dataset [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/16Ni8NxRDH_dz9ejz7lHOrOcAKO2a2Hm3?usp=sharing)

3. 3D Plane Detection and Reconstruction from a Single Image Dataset [Link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10lzwIEBFvRJqA5FlbEE3FYXIDp-IIhFd?usp=sharing).
(The smaller folder contains only the plane images while the bigger one contains all the output generated by the network).

* SO, we collected the dataset containing the images (3590 images) of people wearing hardhat, vest, mask, and boots and annotated them using [YoloV3_Annotation_Tool](https://github.com/miki998/YoloV3_Annotation_Tool).
The first link contains this dataset (images and the .txt files for each image's labels depicting the position of the bounding boxes drawn).

* NEXT, in order to get the inverse depth images, we made inference on [this](https://github.com/intel-isl/MiDaS) pretrained model on our collected dataset images.
The second link contains the generated dataset images.

* FINALLY, we made inference on [this](https://github.com/NVlabs/planercnn) pretrained model which uses MaskRCNN to get the planar regions in an image. The output images are of size 640x480. 
The third link contains the generated dataset images.

Please note that the third model was trained with `cuda8.0 + gcc5+ torch 0.4.0`. After that change to `torch 0.4.1` and the execute `evaluate.py` in `NVlabs/planercnn`. Or just run the bash script `!bash planercnn_cuda.sh` on colab and it will take care of the dependencies and compiling the `nms` and `roi align` files in the `NVlabs/planercnn` folder.
